                <h4>About the Program</h4>
                <p class="lead">The Interactive Mechanics Fellowship Program is a <b>paid, part-time, low-residency program</b> that provides portfolio development, hard and soft skill building, and networking opportunities <b>for entry and junior-level designers and developers</b>.</p>
                <p>This nine-month fellowship aims to <b>build capacity for representation and inclusion in the technology field</b>, and we see it as a mutual learning experience for the fellows and for our existing team. Designed to remove some of the common barriers to members of groups historically underrepresented in the tech field, key features include a small stipend for fellows’ time, a part time and remote schedule to allow for other commitments, and facilitated conversations on soft skills and workplace culture issues.</p>
                <p>Fellows work September through May on a portfolio-building project relating to one of Interactive Mechanics’ areas of interest: higher education, museums, or arts and culture. This fellowship is focused on developing <b>both hard and soft skills</b>, providing hands-on technical guidance in addition to one-on-one mentorship and the opportunity to discuss current issues in the tech workspace. You’ll also build a network in the technology industry and enhance your portfolio.</p>
                <p>With the support of their individual mentors, fellows will set clear goals and build projects that will develop their skills in design, front end development, and/or back end development. <b>Our emphasis is on deep learning over time</b> rather than quick, shiny demos, so goals do not necessarily need to connect to a comprehensive and complete project.</p>

                <h4>Mentorship Project</h4>
                <p>During orientation, your mentor will help you clarify your goals for the fellowship, and work with you to design a project and education plan tailored to your learning objectives. Your work on this project will be remote, with scheduled weekly mentor checkins via phone, Slack, or Hangouts.</p>

But by night, she runs a music blog called Metal&Coffee and hosts a metal radio show on WKDU Philadelphia 91.7 FM. Ebonie did some coding academically but first knew that she wanted to become a front-end developer for sure when she took on the tasks of building her Metal&Coffee music blog on a Wordpress Framework and making it live. Ebonie looks forward to gaining all the necessary skills through the Interactive Mechanics Fellowship. <b>Ebonie re-designed and re-deployed the supporting website for weekly Philadelphia radio show Metal&Coffee, which features a lot of local and international metal music.</b></p>

She is interested in graphic solutions, technology narratives across cultures, and putting the tools of technology into the hands of the people. She studies Computer Science and Information Systems at Stockton University in New Jersey. Madilynn puts her passion into practice by serving as an Bonner AmeriCorps Lead Tutor at Stanley Holmes Homework Completion Program, a public housing complex in Atlantic City. Maddy’s biggest goal is to make tech cool for young women of color, and help them to see themselves as programmers, designers, and developers. <b>Madilynn designed a "Choose your own adventure" interactive game based on Mae Jemison’s life.</b></p>

One day, she started a blog and quickly realized some limitations in not knowing how to code. She enrolled and graduated from a web development program at Delaware County Community College. Candace is excited to be a part of the Interactive Mechanics fellowship and aspires to be a web developer, where she can code and build projects that reach people in an engaging way. In her free time, Candace volunteers with Girl Develop It, enjoys video and photography and meeting new people. <b>Candace built the Inventor Project, an interactive app that features inventors of color and their meaningful contributions to society.</b></p>

                    <h2>Christina</h2>
                    <p>I am an experienced, supportive mentor who can help develop the skills and confidence to achieve your goals! I have expertise in the following areas: best practices in HTML; intermediate and advanced CSS; practical applications of JavaScript and jQuery; building custom themes from scratch for WordPress; PHP; building maps with Mapbox and Leaflet; Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages; command line basics; Chrome Dev Tools; quality assurance processes and protocol; debugging tactics; and a bunch of tools that make life easier (Bootstrap, Gulp, Grunt, etc.).</p>
                    <p>I am known as a dependable, nurturing mentor who gives candid, honest advice and direction. I am organized, am skilled at envisioning projects from beginning to end, and have an eye for detail. I am dependable and generous. I am a planner and a goal-setter.</p>
                    <p>I wrote my very first line of code in 2013, when I was a fundraiser for an arts organization, and I can also provide guidance to those who are transitioning to web development from another career, or who are making other significant changes in their lives. I have skills relating to conflict and crisis management, self-care, and personal growth.</p>
                    <p>I think I can be most helpful to someone who has beginner front-end development skills and is committed to a career as a developer. I expect my mentee to be resourceful, responsible, considerate, organized, and motivated; I appreciate a person who values design, usability, and accessibility as much a well-structured, readable code.</p>

                    <h2>Tara</h2>
                    <p>I am an interactive designer at Interactive Mechanics. While I have worked a variety of jobs, my degree and passion is in animation and graphic design. I’m a firm believer that design work is most impactful when it has a meaningful story. My animation degree also means I use GIFs as my main form of communication while using Slack, a fact all my coworkers can both ardently and wearily attest to. I work well with self-motivated folks who appreciate the power of humor, enjoy learning, and want to “do good through art.”</p>
                    <p>I am hoping to help you, future fellow out there in the void of internet space, hone your design, animation, and/or storytelling skills. I want to create a safe and supportive environment so you feel empowered taking unexpected approaches to your work. I believe we, as artists, are always stronger together. Tools we will most likely use are the Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro, and, yes, even Animate if the project calls for it), online tutorials like Lynda, and Marvel. We will also be working on those always useful soft skills, like discussing your work in a professional setting and networking and interviewing techniques. 
                    <p>Also, you may consider getting access to Turner Classic Movies because I will at times side track everything to talk about folks like Lucille Ball and Ginger Rogers.</p>

                    <h2>Mike</h2>
                    <p>As the Creative Director with Interactive Mechanics, I’m looking to mentor someone with a wide range of interests and skills. I’ve worn a lot of different hats in my career—including graphic design, interface and interaction design, user experience design, frontend development, video production and editing, and project management—and I’d love to share these skills with you. I often apply an empathy-driven mindset to communication. Stability, attention to detail, and adaptability are some of my strengths and values.</p>
                    <p>I’m looking to work with a mentee who is interested in developing a strong design foundation, an appreciation for user experience and empathetic design, and—most importantly—confidence in their work and process. Some of the tools we may use include the Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator), Sketch, Marvel or InVision, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and user experience methodologies like persona development and usability testing. I’ll also work with you to develop soft skills in communication, networking, interviewing, and entrepreneurship.</p>

                    <h2>Jeff</h2>
                    <p>I do development at Interactive Mechanics. I tend to have a somewhat dark and tongue-in-cheek humor. It can be hard to get a read on whether I'm serious or joking, so I'd say 95% of the time, I'm joking. I'm all about 90’s references whether they be cartoons, sitcoms, or even commercials. I appreciate a good meme and gif, mhmm that's what life's all about right there.</p>
                    <p>On a more serious note, I'm interested in User Experience, Human Factors, Human Centered Design and Product/Lean Strategy. I attend a fair bit of meetups just talking to different founders and enjoy coming up with go-to-market strategies or talking about new trends in the tech space. I also like to talk politics, but never on the first date.</p>
                    <p>Pivoting to tech is a broad objective, and my goal is to help you figure out what you want to do. I want to work with someone who will dabble in different areas to see what you like and don’t, so we can narrow it down together. I'm here to break things down for you into biteable, actionable, and doable pieces. (I’d recommend reading my previous mentee’s article on information overload -- it’s really good.) Also, if you tell me what you're interested in, I will reach out to people I know in the field and you can ask them more questions.</p>
                    <p>Full disclosure, I pronounce GIF as JIF. If this is a deal breaker for you, I completely understand, just note you are wrong in your pronunciation and this too shall pass. #TeamJIFNotTeamJacob.</p>
