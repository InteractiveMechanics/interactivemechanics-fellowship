                <h4>About the Program</h4>
                <p class="lead">The Interactive Mechanics Fellowship Program is a <b>paid part-time, low-residency program</b> that provides portfolio development, hard and soft skill building, and networking opportunities for <b>entry and junior-level designers and/or developers</b>.</p>
                <p>This nine-month fellowship aims to <b>build capacity for representation and inclusion in the technology field</b>, and we see it as a mutual learning experience for the fellows and for our existing team. Designed to remove some of the common barriers to members of groups historically underrepresented in the tech field, key features include a small stipend for fellows’ time, a part time and remote schedule to allow for other commitments, and facilitated conversations on soft skills and workplace culture issues.</p>
                <p>Fellows work September through May on a portfolio-building project relating to one of Interactive Mechanics’ areas of interest: higher education or arts and culture. This fellowship is focused on developing <b>both hard and soft skills</b>, providing hands-on technical guidance in addition to one-on-one mentorship and the opportunity to discuss current issues in the tech workspace. You’ll also build a network in the technology industry and enhance your portfolio.</p>
                <p>With the support of their individual mentors, fellows will set clear goals and build projects that will develop their skills in design, front end development, and/or back end development. <b>Our emphasis is on deep learning over time</b> rather than quick, shiny demos, so goals do not necessarily need to connect to a comprehensive and complete project.</p>

                <h4>Mentorship Project</h4>
                <p>During orientation, your mentor will help you clarify your goals for the fellowship, and work with you to design a project tailored to your learning objectives. Your work on this project will be remote, with scheduled weekly mentor check-ins via phone or hangouts, as well as email and slack communication as needed.</p>

            <div class="block block-one-wide block-one-tall block-feature">
                <h4>Monthly Roundtables</h4>
                <p>You’ll meet with the other fellows and Interactive Mechanics staff once a month at our downtown office to participate in a roundtable discussion with an industry leader. Topics will include interpersonal communication, project management, and work/life balance. This is also an opportunity to share updates on your projects with the group.</p>

                <h4>Office Hour Coaching</h4>
                <p>In addition to your work with your mentor, you’ll have access to the full range of expertise of our team. Each staff member will offer monthly office hours and a list of topics they’re prepared to discuss, from user experience to content strategy to networking tips.</p>
