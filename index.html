                <h4>About the Program</h4>
                <p class="lead">The Interactive Mechanics Fellowship Program is a <b>paid part-time, low-residency program</b> that provides portfolio development, hard and soft skill building, and networking opportunities for <b>entry and junior-level designers and/or developers</b>.</p>
                <p>This nine-month fellowship aims to <b>build capacity for representation and inclusion in the technology field</b>, and we see it as a mutual learning experience for the fellows and for our existing team. Designed to remove some of the common barriers to members of groups historically underrepresented in the tech field, key features include a small stipend for fellows’ time, a part time and remote schedule to allow for other commitments, and facilitated conversations on soft skills and workplace culture issues.</p>
                <p>Fellows work September through May on a portfolio-building project relating to one of Interactive Mechanics’ areas of interest: higher education or arts and culture. This fellowship is focused on developing <b>both hard and soft skills</b>, providing hands-on technical guidance in addition to one-on-one mentorship and the opportunity to discuss current issues in the tech workspace. You’ll also build a network in the technology industry and enhance your portfolio.</p>
                <p>With the support of their individual mentors, fellows will set clear goals and build projects that will develop their skills in design, front end development, and/or back end development. <b>Our emphasis is on deep learning over time</b> rather than quick, shiny demos, so goals do not necessarily need to connect to a comprehensive and complete project.</p>

                <p>During orientation, your mentor will help you clarify your goals for the fellowship, and work with you to design a project tailored to your learning objectives. Your work on this project will be remote, with scheduled weekly mentor check-ins via phone or hangouts, as well as email and slack communication as needed.</p>

But by night, she runs a music blog called Metal&Coffee and hosts a metal radio show on WKDU Philadelphia 91.7 FM. Ebonie did some coding academically but first knew that she wanted to become a front-end developer for sure when she took on the tasks of building her Metal&Coffee music blog on a Wordpress Framework and making it live.

She studies Computer Science and Information Systems at Stockton University in New Jersey. Madilynn puts her passion into practice by serving as an Bonner AmeriCorps Lead Tutor at Stanley Holmes Homework Completion Program, a public housing complex in Atlantic City.

One day, she started a blog and quickly realized some limitations in not knowing how to code. She enrolled and graduated from a web development program at Delaware County Community College. Candace is excited to be apart of the Interactive Mechanics fellowship and aspires to be a web developer, where she can code and build projects that reach people in an engaging way. In her free time, Candace volunteers with Girl Develop It, enjoys video and photography and meeting new people. <b>Candace is building the Inventor Project, an interactive app that features inventors of color and their meaningful contributions to society.</b></p>
