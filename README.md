# interactivemechanics-basic-project
A basic project template that we can keep building on for starting new web projects. Right now, this is pretty simple: just a basic structure for working with SASS so we're all on the same page, and bower for getting depedencies.

### Instructions
*  Start your new project by downloading the zipped version.
*  From terminal, run `bower install` to get all the dependencies.
*  Start editing! Don't commit back to this repo unless you're making changes to it.

#### Don't have bower?
*  First, make sure you have [Node.js and NPM installed](https://nodejs.org/en/).
*  From terminal, run `npm install -g bower` to install bower globally. You might need sudo.

### Future improvements
*  Add in Grunt for automation.
*  Add in a version/branch for Angular projects with basic structure.
*  Add in some more complex JavaScript structure.
*  Pull in Bootstrap's Sass files to give more control of variables/mixins.
